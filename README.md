# Smart-Sprouts - Automating Efficient Irrigation for Healthy Plant Growth

![Smart-Sprouts Logo](logo.png)

## Introduction

Smart-Sprouts is an automated irrigation system designed to optimize watering practices for efficient plant growth. By leveraging Arduino Mega microcontroller, soil moisture sensors, and weather sensors, Smart-Sprouts intelligently determines the optimal watering schedule for each plant. The system continuously monitors soil moisture levels and weather conditions, ensuring plants receive the right amount of water at the right time. With features such as sensor integration, intelligent algorithms, and a user-friendly interface, Smart-Sprouts promotes water conservation and simplifies the irrigation process. Improve the health and vibrancy of your plants with Smart-Sprouts!

## Getting Started

To set up Smart-Sprouts, follow these steps:

1. **Hardware Setup:** Connect the Arduino Mega microcontroller to the sensors following the provided wiring diagram (found in the "docs" folder). Ensure all connections are secure and properly aligned.

2. **Software Setup:** Install the Arduino IDE on your computer and open the Smart-Sprouts code file (`smart_sprouts.ino`). Connect the Arduino Mega microcontroller to your computer using a USB cable.

3. **Upload the Code:** In the Arduino IDE, select the appropriate board ("Arduino Mega") and port. Click the "Upload" button to compile and upload the code to the microcontroller.

4. **Configure Sensor Calibration:** Depending on the specific sensors used, calibrate them to provide accurate readings. Refer to the sensor manufacturer's documentation for calibration instructions and adjust the code accordingly.

5. **Adjust Settings:** Open the code file and modify the settings variables to meet your requirements. Parameters such as watering intervals, sensor thresholds, and plant-specific information can be adjusted.

6. **Connect and Power the Sensors:** Connect the soil moisture sensors and weather sensors to the corresponding ports on the Arduino Mega microcontroller. Ensure the sensors have a reliable power source.

7. **Deploy and Monitor:** Once the code is uploaded and the sensors are connected, deploy the Smart-Sprouts system to your garden or plant area. Monitor the interface to observe real-time data and make any necessary adjustments to the watering settings.
